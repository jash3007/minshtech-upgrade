### What is a social media content calendar?

A social media content calendar is a well-planned document that outlines the upcoming posts for all your social media channels. It includes the specific dates and times for publishing these posts. This content calendar serves as a strategic tool to keep your social media presence organized and ensure a consistent and effective posting schedule.
One can use a digital calendar app, spreadsheet, or a third-party tool to manage social content calendars. The image below represents a sample social media calendar.
